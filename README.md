This project is the first project to in the Odin Project Foundations course.

**Full Disclaimer: I have completed this before in Odin, but am redoing the Foundations section of Odin to solidify the knowledge I'd gained.**

This project is to be a website consisting of a homepage and a few recipe pages. 
Through the completion of this project (Recipes - as is exactly required by this particular project), I will have demonstrated that I:
    - am able to link multiple pages together through the use of the anchor tag,
    - am able to construct webpages through the use of basic html & css
    - understand how to navigate directories and files
    - am able to add images, lists both ordered and unordered
