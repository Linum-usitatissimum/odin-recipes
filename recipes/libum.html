    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Libum was a sacrificial cake offered to the household spirits, but the Romans ate it as well!</p>
    <p>The following recipe is from the book De Agri Cultura by Cato, who was a consul, statesman, and soldier. I'm sure he got the recipe from his cook.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup plain all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup clear honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat the cheese until soft; stir into the flour.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten egg to the flour/cheese mixture, forming a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into four and shape each piece into a bun.</li>
        <li>Place on a greased baking tray with a fresh bay leaf underneath.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375°F/190°C. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Warm the honey, pour it into a flat plate, and place the buns on it to rest until the honey is absorbed.</li>
    </ol>
