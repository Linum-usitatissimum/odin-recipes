    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The dormouse, a delicacy but considered a rodent or a pest today. It is quite literally a big fat rat. Yum yum! Made here with chicken drumsticks instead.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>1 cup plain all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 tsp caraway seeds</li>
        <li>2 tsp sweet paprika powder</li>
        <li>1 tbspn honey</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>A dash vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the cumin seeds using a mortar and pestle or equivalent.</li>
        <li>Put the flour in a plastic bag with crushed cumin, bay leaves, caraway, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Lightly dab some vegetable oil on the drumsticks and toss them in the bag with the flour.</li>
        <li>Drop the honey into the bag. Give it a swirl around and leave the bag in the fridge overnight, so the flavours sink in.</li>
        <li>Place the drumsticks in a lightly oiled baking pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until a skewer pushed into the thickest part releases only clear juice.</li>
    </ol>
