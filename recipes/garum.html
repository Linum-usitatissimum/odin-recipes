    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is probably exactly how you would imagine it would be - a sauce made from fermented (and liquified) fish.</p>
    <p>From Gargilius Martialis, who wrote De medicina et de virtute herbarum:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>fatty fish (like sardines)</li>
        <li>dill, coriander, fennel, celery, mint, oregano</li>
        <li>heaps of salt</li>
        <li>a 26 to 35 quart capacity well-sealed container</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use fatty fish, like sardines, and a well-sealed (pitched) container with a 26- to 35-quart capacity.
        </li>
        <li>Add dried, aromatic herbs possessing a strong flavor—such as dill, coriander, fennel, celery, mint, oregano, and others—making a layer on the bottom of the container; then put down a layer of fish (if small, leave them whole; if large, use pieces), and over this, add a layer of salt two fingers high.</li>
        <li>Repeat these layers until the container is filled. Let it rest for seven days in the sun. Then mix the sauce daily for 20 days. After that, it becomes a liquid.
        </li>
    </ol>
